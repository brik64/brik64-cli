# Beta15.4 Ralph Loop Log

## Iteration 1

- Loaded clean branch `codex/beta15-4-rust-polymer-l6` at `e7b1d4b7ab27e0c651c798470bab3d063796fae0`.
- Confirmed package version was `0.1.0-beta.15.3`.
- Located Rust defect in `renderDomainAssertions`: generated `assert_domain(...)` referenced every domain in a polymer contract, including domains not present in the Rust function scope.
- Applied causal fix so Rust `assert_domain(...)` validates only entrypoint parameters and delegates broad helper checks to `assert_domain_value(...)`.
- Added Beta15.4 PCD contracts under `pcd/beta15_4/`.
- Added `scripts/beta15_4-rust-polymer-domain-gate.js`.
- First gate run failed because Rust generated unused helper warnings for non-root polymer functions.
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to generated Rust local/import helper functions.
- Second gate run passed: `PASS_BRIK64_CLI_BETA15_4_RUST_POLYMER_DOMAIN_GATE`.
- Certified Beta15.4 PCD contracts.

Evidence:

- `evidence/beta15_4-rust-polymer-domain/report.json`

## Iteration 2

- Added Beta15.4 pre-public, stale-surface, package, and package-smoke scripts.
- `npm run gate:beta15.4:pre-public-rc` passed.
- `npm run package:beta15.4:local` passed with `releaseEligible=false`.
- `npm run smoke:beta15.4:package` passed from the generated tarball.
- Added Beta15.4 candidate branch handling to `scripts/release-train-dry-run.js`.
- `npm run gate:cli:l6-generation-required` blocked as expected because `evidence/beta15_4-l6-generation/` does not exist.
- `npm run release:train:dry-run -- --allow-dirty` failed closed only on `cli_l6_generation_required`.

Active blocker:

- `missing_l6_generation_evidence_dir:evidence/beta15_4-l6-generation`
